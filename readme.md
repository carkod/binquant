# Binquant (beta)

Binbot quantitative analyses tool.

Performs technical and statistical analysis and feeds it to the signal and telegram systems to eventually create autotrades for Binbot.

Potential replacement of binbot-research, but using Kafka, which hopefully will solve memory and EOL issues that currently are present using websockets polling.
